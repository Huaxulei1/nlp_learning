The success of the tiktok comes from solving the problem of "tiktok". All of these should be based on the recommendation algorithm of "trembling" and the manual recommendation mechanism. A professor who works in Tiktok, has revealed that after learning the user's interest, the machine will push similar videos according to a certain frequency, but it will not push a certain kind of video too much to cause users' aesthetic fatigue.Tiktok will also manually select some excellent content, push it to fans, and interested users. What's more important is the operation. The master tiktok will also imitate the ordinary user through operation after releasing the creative video. When a certain kind of creative video is popular, the machine will also make more recommendations for this kind of video to attract ordinary users to participate. Meanwhile, the tiktok official and users can issue topic challenges and guide users to create on the same topic. The machine will recommend topics of interest to the user.
